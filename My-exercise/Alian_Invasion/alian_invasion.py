# In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at 
# the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
# right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
# spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
# and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
# destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet 
# appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits 
# the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player 
# loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
